# content-brief-with-python

I was surfing around for some python scripts related to SEO when i came across this https://www.semrush.com/blog/python-content-briefs-seo/

As inspiring this post was, I did not want to pay for or sign-up for a SERPStack membership and wanted to see if a solution can be offered for the average user

I then looked to https://hackernoon.com/how-to-scrape-google-with-python-bo7d2tal and https://edmundmartin.com/scraping-google-with-python/ to get started

Towards the end of the second half of the script, I needed assistance and I was able to find a Python freelancer to help me finish the script

This script does the following:

A. Take in keyword that you specify

B. Run a google search in incognito mode

C. Scrape the top 10 organic results on Google

D. Extract words that are contained in key html tags on a web page

E. Give you a starting point as to what should a writer cover in your content pieces based on what items are contained in the top 10 results

Key Takeaways:

A. I recommend that this script be used as a starting point for a content brief. Mimicing or addressing the sub topcis related to a keyword that has been covered by others will not get you high rankings (lets forget about links etc for a minute).

B. In addition to the base line of the sub-topics (which this script helps with), please refer to the 10X Content article here - https://moz.com/blog/how-to-create-10x-content
If anything this script may help with Step 1 of the 10X content process by showcasing which angles of content have been covered already
